# Day 9 - Linux Basics Part 1

Todayâ€™s focus was on getting hands-on with essential Linux commands:

- Navigating the filesystem (`pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `tree`)  
- File and directory operations (`touch`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`)  
- Understanding and modifying permissions (`chmod`, `chown`, `ls -l`)  
- Managing packages with APT (`apt update`, `apt upgrade`, `apt install`)  
- Searching and finding files and content (`find`, `grep`, `locate`)  
- Viewing help and documentation (`man`, `--help`, `info`)

I practiced creating, moving, and deleting files and directories, changing permissions, installing packages like `git`, and using search commands effectively.

This README summarizes the key skills and commands learned on Day 9.
