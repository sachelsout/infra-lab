# 🧱 infra-lab: My 3-Month Infra Engineering Journey

This repository documents my **3-month journey to learn Infrastructure Engineering** through a series of hands-on projects. Each folder represents a day's dedicated project, starting from Docker fundamentals to integrating databases and static file handling.

---

## 🔧 Projects Overview (Days 1–7)

### 1. [flask-docker-app](https://github.com/sachelsout/infra-lab/tree/main/flask-docker-app)
**A simple Flask web app containerized using Docker.**  
📚 Learned how to create Dockerfiles and expose Flask apps through containers.

---

### 2. [flask-ml-docker-app](https://github.com/sachelsout/infra-lab/tree/main/flask-ml-docker-app)
**A machine learning model (Logistic Regression on Iris dataset) exposed via a Flask API and containerized using Docker.**  
📚 Learned model serving and reproducible ML environments.

---

### 3. [flask-redis-compose-app](https://github.com/sachelsout/infra-lab/tree/main/flask-redis-compose-app)
**A simple counter web app using Flask and Redis, containerized using Docker Compose.**  
📚 Understood service orchestration using `docker-compose`.

---

### 4. [flask-redis-volume-app](https://github.com/sachelsout/infra-lab/tree/main/flask-redis-volume-app)
**A Redis-backed counter with Docker volume for data persistence.**  
📚 Focused on Docker **volumes** and **state persistence**.

---

### 5. [postgres-flask-app](https://github.com/sachelsout/infra-lab/tree/main/postgres-flask-app)
**A Flask + PostgreSQL web app using Docker Compose.**  
📚 Integrated a real SQL database, handled form submissions, and used environment variables and database persistence.

---

### 6. [file-upload-app](https://github.com/sachelsout/infra-lab/tree/main/file-upload-app)
**Web app for uploading and serving files with bind mount persistence.**  
📚 Learned Flask file handling, secure uploads, and bind mounting.

---

### 7. [static-file-server](https://github.com/sachelsout/infra-lab/tree/main/static-file-server)
**A static file server using Flask with bind mounts.**  
📚 Served HTML templates and static assets (like CSS/images) with hot-reload via bind mounts.

## 🌱 Ongoing Plan

This is just the first week! Over the coming weeks, I’ll explore:

- CI/CD workflows  
- NGINX reverse proxies  
- Container security  
- Kubernetes  
- Logging & monitoring  
- Full-stack infra setups

Stay tuned!
