# üß± infra-lab: My 3-Month Infra Engineering Journey

This repository documents my **3-month journey to learn Infrastructure Engineering** through a series of hands-on projects. Each folder represents a day's dedicated project, starting from Docker fundamentals to integrating databases, CI/CD, and more.
